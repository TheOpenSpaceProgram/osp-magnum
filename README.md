OpenSpaceProgram is an open source initiative with the goal of creating a realistic spacecraft building game inspired by Kerbal Space Program.

[[Website](https://openspaceprogram.org/)]  [[Discord Server](https://discord.gg/7xFsKRg)]

Putting gameplay details aside (art, story, progression, etc...), a game of this nature requires a massive and complicated universe simulation with intricate vehicles, rigid-body physics, orbits, and literally rocket science. To avoid inevitably creating an unmaintainable buggy mess, we need a strong foundation built with considerable amounts of engineering and passion.

***Introducing OSP-Magnum***

Goals:

* Fast, multi-threaded, and runs on everything
* Powerful API with mods / plugins
* Components reusable in other similar projects

After heavy iteration, it became apparent that it's impractical to build over an off-the-shelf game engine. Major components of OSP-Magnum (vehicles, planet terrain, code utilities, etc...) are designed as separate libraries that are usable on their own, independent of any game engine.

## Features

* C++20
* Data-oriented design
  * This basically means common data for multiple 'things' are often represented as big arrays instead of individual classes/objects
  * Best utilizes the CPU you paid for, instead of being wasted by memory bottlenecks
  * Simpler code, easier to multithread, and no overcomplicated inheritance hierarchy spaghetti
  * Might be Entity-component-system???
* Scene Graph
* Jolt Physics integration
* Vehicles
  * Part model format uses Standard glTF
  * 'Link System' - Parts communicate like components in a logic circuit simulator. (PID control anything, differential thrust, auto-landing... Too many possibilities!)
* Planet terrain, Icosahedron-based tessellation
* Tasks and Framework utilities
* Runnable Test application demo
  * OpenGL renderer using Magnum
  

Upcoming major features

* See https://github.com/TheOpenSpaceProgram/osp-magnum/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aplanned


Notes:

* No multi-threading is implemented yet
  * Code is structured in a way that is easy to *efficiently* multithread in the future 
  * Don't underestimate how fast a single thread can be. This won't be a problem for a while


## Building

These are simplified build instructions for an Ubuntu computer. Windows and Mac OS X build instructions are slightly different.

See our [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/TheOpenSpaceProgram/osp-magnum/tree/master/.github/workflows) for examples on how to get building for your environment

Install some dependencies, configure the build, build the build!

```bash
sudo apt install -y build-essential git cmake libsdl2-dev
git clone --depth=1 --recurse-submodules --shallow-submodules https://github.com/TheOpenSpaceProgram/osp-magnum.git osp-magnum
mkdir build-osp-magnum
cmake -B build-osp-magnum -S osp-magnum -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
cmake --build build-osp-magnum --parallel --config Release --target osp-magnum
```

Run the unit tests!

```bash
cmake --build build-osp-magnum --parallel --config Release --target compile-tests
ctest --schedule-random --progress --output-on-failure --parallel --no-tests error --build-config Release --test-dir build-osp-magnum/test
```

Run the testapp!

```bash
cd build-osp-magnum/Release
./osp-magnum
```

This will bring up the "OSP-Magnum Temporary Debug CLI." From here you can enter commands to run a scenario, like `vehicles`.

If you just want to try the demo without building, then see the [Actions](https://github.com/TheOpenSpaceProgram/osp-magnum/actions) tab on GitHub to obtain automated builds for Linux or Windows.

## Contributing

Our development team is very small right now. We need more crew to help to launch this project to its first release.

You *don't* need to be a professional C++ developer to be involved or help! Graphics, sounds, game design, and scientific accuracy are important to this project too.

### Resources

* [Architecture.md](docs/architecture.md)
* [Framework Unit test / Tutorial](test/framework/main.cpp)
* [1 hour 30 minute long technical introduction video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdUllp9-E6k)
* [Informal project history from BDFL's perspective](https://gist.github.com/Capital-Asterisk/a22c81ffff1bf20d5023bdd40909d31d)

Feel free to ask questions on Github or Discord (even, and especially, the stupid ones); this will greatly help with documentation.

## Random Notes
* This project might be codenamed 'adera'. the name of the street the 49 UBC bus was at while the project files were first created.
* If there are problems with DPI scaling, then run with command line arguments `--magnum-dpi-scaling 1.0`
* As a general-purpose space flight simulator with no reliance on a heavy game engine, this project might have some real applications for aerospace simulation and visualization, such as:
  * Education
  * Amature rocketry
  * Small aerospace companies
* This project isn't intended to be much of a "clone" of Kerbal Space Program. As of now, it's mostly a game engine intended for space flight, with no real gameplay yet.
