/**
 * @brief Data to support Parts in a scene
 *
 * 'Part' refers to a more complex physical 'thing' in a scene, such as a
 * rocket engine, fuel tank, or a capsule.
 *
 * ACtxParts provides the following feature:
 * * Basic structural connections using 'RigidGroups'
 * * A physical model for visual and colliders using a Prefab
 *
 * Rigid groups
 * * Parts that are structurally fixed together make a RigidGroup.
 * * Parts within the same rigid group store transforms relative to the same
 *   (arbitrary) origin.
 * * Storing potentially messy 'part-to-part' transforms are not required.
 * * Parts can retain their original transform after separations or other.
 *   structural modifications, preventing precision errors from accumolating
 * * An external system can use RigidGroups to generate physics constraints
 *   or parent together Prefabs.
 *
 * Additional features are added in other structs.
 *
 * Note that unlike the universe, scenes don't have a concept of 'vehicles'.
