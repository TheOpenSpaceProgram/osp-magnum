/**
 * @brief Float Signal Links, allowing Machines to pass floats to each other
 *
 * Setup:
 * * Each machine type provides an update event tag in idMachEvtTags.
 *   eg: tgMhRocketEvt and tgMhRcsDriverEvt
 *
 *
 * Passing values:
 *
 * 1. Tasks write new values to sigFloat.di.sigUpdFloat
 *
 * 2. The "Reduce Signal-Float Nodes" task reads new values from sigFloat.di.sigUpdFloat(s) and writes them
 *    into sigFloat.di.sigValFloat. This changes the input values of connected Machines, marking them dirty.
 *    Tags for each unique dirty machine type is added to rMachUpdEnqueue.
 *    Other 'reduce node' tasks could be running in parallel here.
 *
 * 3. The "Enqueue Machine & Node update tasks" task from setup_parts runs, and enqueues machine
 *    tasks from rMachUpdEnqueue as well as every tgNodeUpdEvt task, including
 *    "Reduce Signal-Float Nodes".
 *
 * 4. Repeat until nothing is dirty
 *
 *
 * This seemingly complex scheme allows different node types to interoperate seamlessly.
 *
 * eg. A float signal can trigger a fuel valve that triggers a pressure sensor which outputs
 *     another float signal, all running within a single frame.
