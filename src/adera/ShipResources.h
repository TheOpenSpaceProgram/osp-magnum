/**
 * Represents a type of consumable ship resource
 *
 * Resources might be quantized differently depending on the rate at which
 * they're consumed. This system allows this quantization to be configured
 * per-resource. Resources will be represented by 64-bit integers to maximize
 * the available precision to avoid infinite-fuel exploits.
 * The 64-bit range is divided into two sections by an arbitrary choice of unit.
 *
 * A resource is specified by a volume, a mass, and a "quanta" value. The
 * "quanta" value specifies the number of bits that represents the volume
 * of resource in the definition. This volume is divided into (2^quanta)
 * pieces, making 1/(2^quanta) the smallest representable quantity of the
 * resource. The remaining (64-quanta) bits of precision represent tank
 * capacity.
 *
 * Example resource:
 * identifier: lox
 * name: Liquid Oxygen
 * quanta: 16
 * mass: 1141.0 (kg) (per 2^quanta)
 * volume: 1.0 (m^3) (per 2^quanta)
 *
 * The smallest representable quantity is unit/(2^quanta), which in this case is:
 * volume: (1.0 m^3)/(2^16) = 1.5e-5 m^3 (15.2 mL)
 * or mass: (1141.0 kg)/(2^16) = 0.017 kg (17.4 g)
 *
 * A fuel tank with volume 10 m^3 would thus store 655360 units of LOx. With 16
 * bits dedicated to the subdivision of 1.0 m^3 of LOx, the remaining 48 bits can
 * represent a maximum fuel capacity up to 281474976710656 m^3 (321 Teratons) of
 * LOx. If you need to store a volume larger than this, we suggest you
 * reevaluate the design of your vessel.
 *
 * In contrast, a theoretical fuel with incredible energy density may only
 * be burned at a rate of micrograms per minute. With a quanta of 32 (and a base
 * volume unit of 1 m^3 as before), value of (1.0 m^3)*2e-10 may be represented,
 * with the tradeoff that the remaining 32 bits of precision may represent
 * "only" 4294967292 m^3.
