/**
 * Represents a type of consumable ship resource
 *
 * Resources might be quantized differently depending on the rate at which
 * they're consumed. This system allows this quantization to be configured
 * per-resource. Resources will be represented by 64-bit integers to maximize
 * the available precision to avoid infinite-fuel exploits.
 * The 64-bit range is divided into two sections by an arbitrary choice of unit.
 *
 * Example resource:
 * identifier: lox
 * name: Liquid Oxygen
 * quantaPerUnit: 2^16
 * mass: 1141.0 (kg) (per quantaPerUnit)
 * volume: 1.0 (m^3) (per quantaPerUnit)
 * 
 * Terminology:
 * 
 * UNIT - The quantity of resource used in its definition. For example, the 
 * above example defines one unit of Liquid Oxygen to contain 1 cubic meter of
 * resource, which masses 1141.0 kilograms.
 * 
 * QUANTA - The resource definition also contains a value which defines the
 * number of "quanta per unit" (QPU). This value is a power of two which
 * determines the smallest representable quantity of the resource. Given a QPU
 * value of 2^16, 16 bits of precision will be used to divide one unit of
 * resource into pieces. In the above exapmle, the smallest representable
 * quantity of resource (1) thus represents 1/(2^16) = 1.526e-5 units, or
 * 15.26ml of LOx. The remaining 48 bits of precision are free to represent
 * tank capacity.
 * 
 * A fuel tank with volume 10 m^3 would thus store 655360 units of LOx. With 16
 * bits dedicated to the subdivision of 1.0 m^3 of LOx, the remaining 48 bits can
 * represent a maximum fuel capacity up to 281474976710656 m^3 (321 Teratons) of
 * LOx. If you need to store a volume larger than this, we suggest you
 * reevaluate the design of your vessel.
 *
 * In contrast, a theoretical fuel with incredible energy density may only
 * be burned at a rate of micrograms per minute. With a quanta of 32 (and a base
 * volume unit of 1 m^3 as before), value of (1.0 m^3)*2e-10 may be represented,
 * with the tradeoff that the remaining 32 bits of precision may represent
 * "only" 4294967292 m^3.
